# Lexar Landing Page Clone

This project is a basic clone of the Lexar landing page header and a placeholder for a slider section, built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for interactive features (currently empty).

## Getting Started

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the page.
2. Add your desired images and videos to the `slider-content` div in `index.html`.
3. Implement the slider functionality in `script.js`.
