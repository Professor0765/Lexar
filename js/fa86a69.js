This limitation does not affect your statutory rights.","policy7":"All third party software provided with the Product is provided “AS IS”.

The original end-user purchaser referred to in this Warranty Policy does not include any purchasers, including, but not limited to, individuals, companies, and/or other entities who purchase and use Lexar products for the purpose of making profits by allowing other individuals, companies and/or other entities to utilize Lexar products, such as rental business.","policy3":"You must have proof of purchase and obtain warranty service authorization from Lexar, including a Return Materials Authorization, or RMA, number within the applicable warranty period before returning defective products to Lexar.

A refund would be the purchase price less any rebates or the current market value of the Product at the time the warranty claim is made to Lexar, whichever is lower.

Lexar cannot, and does not, guarantee that your data will not be accessed by unauthorized persons, and Lexar disclaims any warranties to that effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts or at all, so the above limitation may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary by jurisdiction. This limitation does not affect your statutory rights.","policy7":"All third party software provided with the Product is provided “AS IS”. You assume the entire risk as to the quality, performance, accuracy and effect of such software, and should it prove defective, you, and not Lexar, assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing or repair.","policy8":"To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event will Lexar be liable for any lost images, data, revenue or profit, or for special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, however caused regardless of the theory of liability, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the product, even if Lexar has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
